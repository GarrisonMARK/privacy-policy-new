      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="container">

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>a) Information You Voluntarily Provide</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, playing Match Chaos does not require you to provide any
        direct personal information.

        contacted about future testing opportunities.
      </p>

      <h3>b) Information Collected Automatically by Third Parties</h3>
      <p>
        Even if you do not provide information to us directly, our third-party
        partners (specifically Google) automatically collect certain information
        when you play our game. This is necessary to deliver advertisements that
        support the game and to analyze our game's performance. This information
        includes:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Device and Usage Information: Your IP address, device type, unique
          device identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID), operating system,

      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To Serve Advertisements: The data collected automatically by our
          partner, Google, is used to provide personalized ads within the game,
          which keeps the game free to play.
        </li>
        <li>
          To Contact You for Game Testing: If you voluntarily sign up for our
          game testing program, we will use the email address you provide to
